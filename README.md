# 3D GAME OF LIFE

Partners:
	
	* Imogen Lea
	* Fabrice B. Mpogazi

Used Libraries:
	
	* Three.js
	* Dat.gui.js

Purpose:
	
	* Visualization of a cell automata system in 3D
	* Learning and using three.js library

Future Improvements:
	
	* A back end. ie. This program might add a feature like time
	  prediction of when the system returns to the initial state,
	  time it takes for the whole generation to die (Whether infinite or
	  finite). However, none of those computations are feasible in a user's
	  browser. It would unnecessarily consume the RAM. However, it can be done
	  using some server side technologies.

	* Addition of some computations to calculate the amount of time it would take
	  to reach stability or the the initial state, etc.

	* Cleaner and more modular code. All the code is just packed in one .js file,
	  which can be improved to promote readability and modularity. However, this
	  project was done in a state of hurry, but it will be improved in the future.
